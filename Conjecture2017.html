            ACM Student Chapter, Chitkara University, organised a half-day fun cum technical event “Conjecture”, on 3rd August 2017 in Bernoulli Hall. A total of 35 teams, and 70 participants, spread across the CSE Department from 2nd and 3rd year, took part in this workshop. First round, named “Handy-Tech”, required a single member from each team to outline their right hand on a sheet of paper within 1 minute, and within that outline including the maximum number of technical words they could in a time-span of 2 minutes. Only 15 teams managed to surpass this round. These results lead to the second round, named “Crypt-o-gizmo”, which involved solving aptitude and logical reasoning questions, thrown in with gadget questions of which a tech junkie would be proud of, made an excellent test of a team’s rationale thinking and knowledge. Only five teams made it through to the final round, titled “Buzzzzzz…”.A buzzer round, it consisted of 10 objective questions based on various disciplines of the computing world, which were designed to test a team’s coordination, reflexes and knowledge in the aforementioned streams.
