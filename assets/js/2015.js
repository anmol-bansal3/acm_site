In this workshop students acknowledged a complete knowledge of basic networking and ethical hacking.This workshop aimed at giving students a basic knowledge of hacking and how they could protect one’s system against hazardous effects. Hacking has been a part of computing for almost five decades and it is a very broad discipline, which covers a wide range of topics.<br> The workshop was an enriching experience for the students and they were amazed to see the scope and practical implications of Hacking in our day to day life. At the end of the workshop certificates were provided to the students.Top two students were selected for the next level of workshop. Students showed keen interest in attending more advanced workshops like this in future.",

In the first section, they went to Class 1 Zone, where they were shown how the fabrication of a wafor takes place which gave them the idea about the initial step for an IC production and how the base layer deposition, electrical layer deposition and sacrificial removal process takes place. In the second section students were taken to the R&D Department. Here they came to know about various techniques to design an IC through VHDL. Next they were taken to de-ionised water plant where they were the process to de-ionise the water and to bring down the resistivity of the water.  Lastly they were taken to class 100 they were shown the packaging process of an IC by soldering or by manual installment of a wafor the package.<br>The head of department also told them how they planned to upgrade the fab after IBM backed out the deal and how SCL was undergoing an upgrade to produce chips of 0.18 micrometers from tower semiconductor, Israel. The students interacted with the officials and gained a lot of knowledge which will be useful for them in their academic",
